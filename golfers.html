        <p>There are three constants in life: Death, Taxes, and Kirk slicing the ball 50 yards across the fairway.
          It remains to be seen if Kirk has fixed his slice in the offseason, but many experts predict that simply isn't 
          possible. He had a tough go in league last year, but he still gives you pretty much what you can expect out of him which 
          is steady golf and a wild time out on the course. Kirk is equipped with a whole new bag of clubs this year so that
          could change his game exponentially. We expect Kirk to go around the middle of the draft.
