              <p>The captain of Team USA. Pudrith did well last year off the course as

              will be and all we can do is speculate for now. Pudrith will hope to continue his success 
              and he will need to continue pounding the driver in order to lead his team to victory. </p>

            <p>As it has for the past two years, Taylor's health remains a question mark heading
              into this tourney. He has shown no signs of recent injury concerns, but his ankle
              can flare up at any moment. Maybe Dr. Barnes can take care of any issues if they are 
              selected to the same team. Anyway, Bisnack remains one of this tournaments best golfers
              and there is no question he will be selected early. He didn't have the best showing in last 
              years Ryder Cup, but he wasn't exactly easy to play against. He loves the game of golf and 
              he is someone who rarely gets too upset on the course. Aside from that one time...

            last year to help give his team the victory and will surely be taken highly in the draft.
            Many fans last year noticed how blitzed Brian was in Round 3 last year and some are hoping he stays
            a little more level headed on game days. It's something the captains will have to consider on draft day.
            Brian is deadly with his irons and after getting a new golf simulator in his basement, it can either 
            revolutionize his golf game or absolutely destroy it. Only time will tell.

              easy, but he will have to put that aside and focus on playing good golf for his team. He has seen 
              some ups and downs in regards to his game the last few years, but he remains one of the most technically
              sound golfers in the field. He is dangerous around the green and we expect him to go within the first few 
              rounds of the draft.

            mentality during this weekend. He was the ace for many years during high school and college, but 
            golf has proved to be a bit more difficult than striking out the side. He is largely unreliable off the tee
            box but has enough skill within 5 feet that he can be valuable to his team. We expect Ryan to go later in the draft, 
            but could be a solid assest with his high HCP.

        <p>We have another newcomer to the field here with Michael and his golf game is relatively 
          unknown to a lot of the players in this tournament. He gets out on the links as much as he can and usually keeps 
          a pretty upbeat attitude regardless of how he is playing. Equipped with a hand me down driver, Mike is steady 
          off the tee box, but his irons and fairway woods are mostly inconsistent. His HCP is pretty spot on with his 
          skill set and he can easily shoot in the 90s when he's on. He could be the wildcard that goes undefeated this year. We
          expect Mike to go middle-late in the draft.

            <p>Mr. Lopez once again comes into this tournament sporting the highest HCP, but what the scorecards

              things aren't going his way. Sometimes golf challenges your mental toughness and he has a ton of that. 
              It's always a question mark where someone like Nick will be taken, but you have to assume the captains 
              won't be taking too many chances on the high HCPs. We expect Nick to go later in the draft, but could end up
              being a late round gem if he can put together a good round or two.

            <p>There are three constants in life: Death, Taxes, and Kirk slicing the ball 50 yards across the fairway.
              It remains to be seen if Kirk has fixed his slice in the offseason, but many experts predict that simply isn't 
              possible. He had a tough go in league last year, but he still gives you pretty much what you can expect out of him which 
              is steady golf and a wild time out on the course. Kirk is hopeful he will be on the same team as Dan or else 
              he'll have no choice but to give him eagle putts again. We expect Kirk to go around the middle of the draft.

        be a great addition to whatever team he is chosen to. With two new puppies at home you have to wonder if all of his energy has
        been spent towards taking care of them. At any rate, Steve will surely be selected within the first 
        round or two and you know he will be fired up to be apart of this years event.

               <p>Coming off a recent change in his life, Brent has decided to drop his old 
                partner in favor of a shiny new toy. Could this be seen as issue for the Captains? Maybe.
                But what Brent can forsure bring to his team is a playlist the size of Texas, clutch putting, 
                and tons of Advil. He experienced a bit of a down year last season so the only way for him to go is 
                up. As long as his allergies don't kill him, Brent will be a solid mid draft addition to whatever team 
                he is chosen to.

                <p>The other part of the League's reinging Champions. Big Pete is a gamer that may not always be reliable on the 
                  course 100% of the time, but he will try his hardest and in big moments he shines. He holds the 
                  unofficial Ryder Cup longest putt record at 41 ft. He did well keeping his off-course actions to a responsible
                  minimum, but you have to wonder if there will be any new movies on Netflix that may cause him to stay up
                  a bit later than the rest of the field. Something the Captains will have to keep an eye on. Pete will likely 
                  go later in the draft.

                <p>Bill can't seem to get enough of the game of golf after joining the golf League as Taylor Bisnack's 
                  new partner. If his biggest issue is loving the game of golf then what a problem to have. It's still 
                  tough to think of any holes in Bill's game and there is no doubt he will be one of the first two picks 
                  of the draft. His smooth as butter swing is always a treat to watch so at the very least he will 
                  bring that to the table.
