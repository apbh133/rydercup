              to last year and many experts are saying he could be an X factor depending on where he is drafted. 
              He was selected 8th overall last year and could have a huge impact if taken around there.

            <p>Taylor loves the game of golf. His only issue for the past two years is that pesky ankle injury, but 
              he has shown no signs of recent injury concerns. Bisnack remains one of this tournaments best golfers
              and there is no question he will be selected early. He didn't have the best showing in last

              he is someone who rarely gets too upset on the course.

          <p>The former captain of Team Europe now enters the field as a regular peasent. He played well enough
            last year to help give his team the victory and will surely be taken highly in the draft.
            Many fans last year noticed how blitzed Brian was in Round 3 last year and some are hoping he stays
            a little more level headed on game days. It's something the captains will have to consider on draft day.
            Brian is deadly with his irons and after getting a new golf simulator in his basement, it can either 
            revolutionize his golf game or absolutely destroy it. Only time will tell.
